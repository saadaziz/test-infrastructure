# Saad's test-infrastructure
making unit testing easy

## Goal
given that coding challenges are the bees knees right now, let's have some boiler plate code ready to run unit tests

## Lazy programming rules
to that end, let's run tests upon saving a file, and execute tests

## Running the tests with nodemon watching
nodemon -x "npm test"
